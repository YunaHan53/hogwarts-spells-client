## Planning Story

I wanted to let the user to be able to sign up, sign in and create their own spells or just use the ones they know. This was inspired 100% by Hogwarts and the Harry Potter series. As a fan of the Harry Potter books and films, I want to build a website where you can extend your imagination and create, update and delete your list of spells. I really like how the page turned out.
I started out doing the user auths first, and then creating my spells resource. I then connected the user to the spells and spent the majority of my project time on getting the API working to create, update, show and delete spells. And then I styled the page using CSS and bootstrap.
